Are you for real? No progress at all, still 78 to do.
Maybe it's bcos of null ass passwd?

`less output_hydra1` - to save current progress

ftp seems like is reacting to any passwd

next try:
`sudo hydra -C .dpl4hydra/dpl4hydra_unix.lst -e r -o output_hydra1 -t 10 ftp://10.0.2.5 -v`
```

 parallelly:
 `nc -vn 10.0.2.5 21`
```

so "Dos" again. I'm beggining to think that ftp block incoming connections after several unsuccessfull attempts for a little time.

`netcat` claim that FTP is up again

`sudo hydra -R -t 5`
