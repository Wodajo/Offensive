`proxychains` - program for making proxy chains D:  
- test how's it working (there were some problems - bad servers? misconfiguration on networking settings?) 


`aigeddon` - great for DoS  

`dspoof` contains i.a. `arpspoof`  

`p0f` passive scanner  

`strace` low lewel program debugging

`sudo wifite -mac --dict /home/kali/Desktop/Pentest/rockyou.txt --kil` nice:>

`sed -z 's/\n/,/g'` needs `-z` flag to change line separators from \n to \0 (null). That way you can substitute newlines.    

- for sneakyness sake - it would be best to configure `fw` and only leave a crevice for `p0f`
