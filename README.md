This repo will slowly transform into personal penetration testing notes

Current vision of how things should be arranged here:

- `commands dir` is meant for thematic notes containing dumps of usefull commands.  
e.g. `escalation` note -> `id`, `whoami`, `groups` and so on - in probable order of use

- `labs dir` is meant for labs ofc

- `ports` is similar to `commands`, but focused on what one can do with port x

- `theory` :  
  - `infrastructures` (organised with `MITRE ATT&CK` matrix for enterprises),  
  - `windows`  
  - `linux`
  - `protocols`

- `tools` is for tools manuals re-written in my way
