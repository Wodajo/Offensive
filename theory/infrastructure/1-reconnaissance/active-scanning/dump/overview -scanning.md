Host discovery -> Port scanning & Banner grabbing -> Searching for vulnerabilities

"ping sweep" -  using ICMP echo request to look for active hosts by quering IP addresses one by one (queries of broadcast addresses often blocked)

In IPv6 there are massive amounts of possible IP addresses - "bruteforce" scanning would take a lot of time.  
It would be best to first look for proven IPv6 addresses in e.g. traffic, emails, logs...

### Host discovery
#### nmap
`-n/R` no/always DNS resolution (default sometimes:p)  
In local ethernet network ARP requests are always used. Unless `--send-ip` or `--disable-arp-ping`

`-sn` no port scans after host discovery. Use ICMP echo request, TCP SYN to port 443, TCP ACK to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request for host discovery  
`-Pn` no host discovery, pass given IPs like with `-sL` would print out  
To skip host discovery & port scanning BUT use NSE `-Pn -sn`  
`-P*` ping scans.  
  `-PS/PA/PU/PY <portlist>` TCP SYN/ACK, UDP or SCTP discovery to given ports  
  `-PE/PP/PM` ICMP type 8 expecting type 0 (blocked by most firewalls but might work in internal networks), ICMP code 13 (timestamp request), ICMP code 17 (network mask)  
  `-PO <protocol list>` "IP protocol ping"  
`--disable-arp-ping` No ARP or IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. Useful on networks using proxy ARP, in which a router replies to all ARP requests making every target appear to be up according to ARP scan  
`--traceroute` typical traceroute using ICMP Time Exceeded  
#### hping3
lower level & stealthier than nmap BUT can be used on 1 target and doesn't support IPv6  
Probably won't be of much usage, but I'm going to run some test with it  
  `hping -1 10.0.0.x --rand-dest -I eth0`  
        `-1` ICMP mode  
        `--rand-dest` random destionation address mode  
        `-I <interface>` network interface name  
**ICMP return of type 3 with a code of 13 indicates a poorly configured firewall**  
#### ping - rather useless
ICMP broadcast `ping -b 192.168.129.255` (last address of a network is broadcast ID)  
This will populate arp table. To show `ip neigh` (from neighbour)  

### Port scanning
#### nmap
`-Pn` no host discovery. Straight to scanning ports  
`-sS/sT/sU/sY` TCP SYN/connect, UDP, SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) - rare but stealthy and accurate  
`-sN/sF/sX` TCP NULL, FIN, and Xmas scans  
`-sW` TCP Window scan  
`-sM` TCP Maimon scan  
`--scanflags` custom TCP flags. You specify how nmap is understanding responses (e.g. `-sF`) and what packets are sent 
(mash flags together e.g. `--scanflags URGACKPSHRSTSYNFIN`). Default is SYN scan understanding of replys  
`-sO` IP scan  
nmap by default scans only firs 1000 most common ports  
Common ports for scanning:  
```
21 tcp FTP  
22 tcp SSH  
23 tcp telnet  
25 tcp SMTP  
53 tcp/udp DNS  
80 tcp HTTP/1.0 HTTP/1.1 HTTP 1.2  
80 udp HTTP/3 (use QUIC)  
123 tcp NTP (Network Time Protocol)  
443 tcp/udp HTTPS  
500 tcp/udp IKE/IPSec (Internet Key Exchange/IPSec)  
631 tcp/udp IPP (InternetPrinting Protocol)  
3389 tcp/udp RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)  
9100 tcp/udp AppSocket/JetDirect (HP JetDirect, Printer PDL (page description language) Data Stream) 
``` 

`-p <port ranges>`port number or range. `-p-` mean all 2^16 ports  
`-p U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080` for specifying sake  
`--exclude-ports <port ranges>`  
`-r` scan ports consecutively (without randomisation)  

### Service and version detection (banner grabbing)
`-sV` service&version detection. By default skips TCP 9100 bcos some printers print everything sent there. `--allports` will overwrite this behavior
