1. Gain networking and sysadmin knowledge and skills:  
- Computer Networking 8th Edition
- TCP/IP illustated
- CCNA preparations (as a framework)
- Configuring your own OSes and Network Devices

1. Use this knowledge in context of security (both offensive and deffensive):
- CEH preparations (as a framework)
- playing around with fw (`pfsense` as first), IPS (`snort`), SIEM (`splunk`/`elasticsearch`& `kaibana`)
- THM?

2. I'm looking forward PNPT, OSCP and CISSP
2. more Sec. Engineering knowledge and skills  
   rather low-level. Try to get a hold of as specific understanding as you can


3. Sec. Engineering in as many different projects across company/ies as you can, so as to get as broad understanding and get the big picture.


4. Threat Modeling env/sys + quantitative risk approach (e.g. FAIR factor analysis of information risk), architectural frameworks (SABSA sherwood applied management, TOGAF the open group architecture framework) -> needed capabilities (e.g. authentication, authorisation, endpoint security, network security etc.) -> required tools  (IDM identity management, PAM privileged access management, NGFW next generation firewall, IPS etc.)  
aka became Sec. Architect.
