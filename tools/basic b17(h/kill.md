Signals sent to processes are handled how developer wanted to. E.g `zsh` doesn't terminate on ctl+d (`QUIT`) when there exist suspended jobs

`INT` `2` - interruption request to process (ctl+c)
`TERM` `15` - clean termination request to process
`KILL` `9` - immediate termination to **kernel** (cannot be ignored)

`TSTP` (terminal stop) `20` - stop request to process (ctr+z - `TSTP` + &)
`STOP` `19` - stop request to **kernel**

`CONT` `18`- restore process after `TSTP` or `STOP` (sent by `fg` and `bg`)
`QUIT` `3` - quit request to process (ctl+d).
should create `core dump` - file that gets automatically generated by kernel after a program crashes. This file contains the `memory`, `register values`, and the `call stack` of an application at the point of crashing
